# 🕹️ Pong Game Project

A classic remake of the iconic **Pong Game** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project recreates the timeless two-player table tennis game, where players control paddles to hit the ball and try to score against each other. A perfect way to experience the nostalgia of one of the earliest video games in a modern browser!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Game structure and canvas elements
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Game mechanics, logic, and player interactions

## ✨ Features
- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend, where each player controls one paddle.
- **Ball physics**: Smooth ball movement with accurate collision detection.
- **Scorekeeping**: Real-time score updates for both players.
- **Responsive design**: Works across different screen sizes (desktops, tablets).
- **Simple and clean UI** for an enjoyable gameplay experience.

## 🚀 Demo

## ⚙️ How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pong-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

### Controls
- **Player 1 (Left Paddle)**: Use `W` (Up) and `S` (Down) keys.
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle)**: Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.

### Objective
- Move your paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from crossing your side of the screen.
- The first player to score 10 points wins!

## 🧩 Code Structure
- **`index.html`**: Contains the structure of the game with the `canvas` element.
- **`style.css`**: Basic styling for the game layout.
- **`script.js`**: The main game logic including paddle movement, ball physics, collision detection, and scorekeeping.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **HTML5 canvas**: Drawing and animating elements.
- **JavaScript event handling**: Detecting user input for paddle movement.
- **Game development principles**: Collision detection, game loop, and rendering.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add **AI** for a single-player mode against the computer.
- [ ] Introduce **sound effects** for paddle hits and scoring.
- [ ] Add a **difficulty setting** to adjust ball speed and paddle sensitivity.
- [ ] Implement **touch controls** for mobile devices.
